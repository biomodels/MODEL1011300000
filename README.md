Abstract:  
Although the genomes of many microbial pathogens have been studied to help
identify effective drug targets and novel drugs, such efforts have not yet
reached full fruition. In this study, we report a systems biological approach
that efficiently utilizes genomic information for drug targeting and
discovery, and apply this approach to the opportunistic pathogen Vibrio
vulnificus CMCP6. First, we partially re-sequenced and fully re-annotated the
V. vulnificus CMCP6 genome, and accordingly reconstructed its genome-scale
metabolic network, VvuMBEL943. The validated network model was employed to
systematically predict drug targets using the concept of metabolite
essentiality, along with additional filtering criteria. Target genes encoding
enzymes that interact with the five essential metabolites finally selected
were experimentally validated. These five essential metabolites are critical
to the survival of the cell, and hence were used to guide the cost-effective
selection of chemical analogs, which were then screened for antimicrobial
activity in a whole-cell assay. This approach is expected to help fill the
existing gap between genomics and drug discovery.

This metabolic network model has been thoroughly validated by the authors.
VvuMBEL943 is a stoichiometric model that contains the metabolic information
of the microbial pathogen, Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6, at genome-scale. The SBML
version was generated by Hyun Uk Kim using MetaFluxNet.
